## 3.Contest
- [2021 DynamicEarthNet Challenge](http://www.classic.grss-ieee.org/earthvision2021/challenge.html) *(TUM, DLR, panet, Mar 2021)*    
The challenge consists of two tracks (**Unsupervised Binary Land Cover Change Detection** and **Weakly-Supervised Multi-Class Change Detection**) in which participants are tasked to detect multi-temporal changes with few or no training labels. 

- [2021 IEEE GRSS Data Fusion Contest: Track MSD (Multitemporal Semantic Change Detection)](https://www.grss-ieee.org/community/technical-committees/2021-ieee-grss-data-fusion-contest-track-msd/) *(GRSS, Microsoft, Jan 2021)*   
The task of Track MSD is to create bitemporal high resolution land cover maps using only low-resolution and noisy land cover labels for training. Such a scenario is often encountered around the world, as the proliferation of new sensors with either high spatial resolution (submeter) or high temporal resolution (weekly or even daily) remains unmatched by equally rich label data. Instead, detecting change would have to rely on the analysis of a sequence of input images in an unsupervised manner or with aid of weak, noisy, and outdated labels.

- [**SpaceNet 7: Multi-Temporal Urban Development Challenge**](https://medium.com/the-downlinq/the-spacenet-7-multi-temporal-urban-development-challenge-dataset-release-9e6e5f65c8d5) *(CosmiQ Works, Planet, Aug 2020)*   
In this challenge, participants will identify and track buildings in satellite imagery time series collected over rapidly urbanizing areas. The competition centers around a new open source dataset of Planet satellite imagery mosaics, which will include 24 images (one per month) covering ~100 unique geographies. The dataset will comprise 40,000 km2 of imagery and exhaustive polygon labels of building footprints in the imagery, totaling over 3M individual annotations. Challenge participants will be asked to track building construction over time, thereby directly assessing urbanization.
